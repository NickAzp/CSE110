### My Code Background
**I am a novice coder**. I am hoping to get better at coding through this course especially with how
it relates to *software engineering*. I am ~~not~~ looking to write cleaner code. 
### Other Than Code
Besides coding, I like to go to the **_gym_**. I have one cat named ***Kuno*** <sub>He can be a menace sometimes</sub> <sup>But I still love him</sup>
A picture of my cat is below:
